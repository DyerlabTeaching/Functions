Let's walk through setting up the first persistent function you have for this class.

Make a `get_rice_data()` function.  It should have:

1. Common units.  
2. DateTime object with columns for Month, Day, Weekday
3. No extraneous columns of data.


Here is the URL.

```{r}
url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mk1YGH9LqjF7drJE-td1G_JkdADOU0eMlrP01WFBT8s/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv"
```

In the section below craft the code that will load in the data and do all the manipulations first.

```{r}

```


Then *wrap* it into a function call **only after the code is finished**.

```{r}
get_rice_data <- function() { 

  # your code from above goes here.  
  
}
```


Test it in this document and then make a copy of it in its own file so you can source it from anywhere.
