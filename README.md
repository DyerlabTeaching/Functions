## Impetus

This topic focuses on how you can create reusable code components to make your life easier.  This is done by bundling chunks of code under an *alias* of a function name.  After that, you can all your own function as if you were executing all that underlying code.  This helps tremendously 

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:  
 - Understanding variable scope and how it relates to visibility and naming conventions as your code becomes more complex.
 - Create general functions that take zero or more input values and return (or not) implicit values to the caller.
 - Understand and implement basic conditional statements based upon logic as well as looping.
